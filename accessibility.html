            <h1>The History of White House Websites</h1>
            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
                I compared accessibility ratings for each website using Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). This is important, because laws require websites like whitehouse.gov to be accessible to those with disabilities. There is some bias here, because guidelines were modified over time, and the archived websites are no longer updated to keep in line with new guidelines.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Trump – No Know Problems
                </li>
                <li>
                    Obama – 9 problems, two related to text contrast
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bush – 44 problems, many related to text contrast and image labeling
                </li>
                <li>
                    Clinton – 49 problems, similar in nature
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I also compared raw quantity of content on each website. There is not a straightforward measurement for this, so I used a proxy and looked at the number of Google search results available for each site (i.e., searching something like site:https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/)
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Trump – 44,600
                </li>
                <li>
                    Obama – 64,500
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bush – 59,700
                </li>
                <li>
                    Clinton – 1,850 + 4,090 + 2,080 + 2,550 + 464 = 11,034
                </li>
            </ul>
            Note: For the Clinton figure, I added up results from version of the website, 1-5.
            <p>
                It is interesting that both Obama and Bush-era websites have more content than the current Trump website, especially since during the Bush era, video and media was still relatively limited. However, since the Trump presidency is still only 2 years in, and both Obama and Bush served 8 year terms, it is possible that more content will be generated over time.
