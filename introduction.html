        <h1>The History of White House Websites</h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            This website serves to compare the White House websites of the Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump presidencies, currently hosted at <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">http://www.whitehouse.gov</a>. The first White House webpage came online during the Clinton presidency, in 1994, and with the Trump presidency, there has been considerable news coverage on the evolution of the purpose of this website. Before the Obama presidency, White House webpages were generally seen as a "giant repository for press releases," without much opinion or administration-specific content.  The Obama team added unique content and created places for citizens to interact with government through the website, including a system for writing petitions. The Obama team also highlighted focused initiatives for the presidency.

            With the Trump presidency, there has been a shift with the purpose and content of the White House website. Much of the news coverage surrounding the website was critical, because the website was still undone during the transition, and on the first day of the presidency, the website was not fully functional. Significantly, the website was used to house statements from the campaign well into the presidency, instead of switching into an administration-focused mode.

            Trump’s White House website is known for removing information from the Obama administration, including mentions of abortion, environmental protection, and LGBT issues.  Additionally, the Trump website does not include a Spanish translation that both the Bush and Obama administrations had.  While the administration says that a Spanish translation is a priority, there is still not one to be found, and this seems to concur with Trump’s anti-immigration stance. Notably, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has an up-to-date Spanish Twitter (@ICEEspanol), while the White House Spanish Twitter has significantly fewer tweets. This makes it seem like the Spanish translation for whitehouse.gov is not a priority.

            This website compares each website and analyzes the differences in context of the presidencies, using website archives.  Because the Clinton presidency had multiple versions of the website, this comparison will primarily use version 5, the last version, of the Clinton website. Each website was archived once the president left office, with as much of the material retained as possible. The layout and design for this website is based on version one of Clinton’s White House website. Analyzing the White House website gives insight into the intended digital image of these presidencies and the changing role of this form of contact with the people. Sources like Twitter and Facebook are more recent, so White House websites are one of the only forms of direct digital engagement that we can compare across more than two presidencies.
