            <h1>The History of White House Websites</h1>
            <h3>News</h3>
            <p>
                This section will compare how easy or difficult it is to find news information on each website, and compare the formats of news presented. 
            </p>
            <h3>Clinton</h3>
            <p>
                The Clinton navigation bar has a link to the Briefing Room, which contains links to press releases, press briefings, and radio addresses. This page can be accessed from any page in the site with only a single click.
            </p>
            <h3>Bush</h3>
            <p>
                The Bush website directly links all news sources in the sidebar itself, so fewer clicks are need to access any specific news source, if the user knows what he or she is looking for. The information is organized by date and includes photos. Notably, there is a specific news section to "Set the Record Straight," which refutes the claims of other news publications like the New York Times that disparage the administration.

            <h3>Obama</h3>
            <p>
                The Obama navigation bar has a link to the Briefing Room, which contains links to a plethora of official White House news, from a blog, to official press briefings, to the schedule, and statements. There is significantly more search functionality on these pages compared to the Clinton ones, and there is an explanation of each type of news source, which provides helpful context to users of the website.

            <h3>Trump</h3>
            <p>
                The Trump website is the only one that requires two clicks to see any sort of news. There are sections for briefings and statements, presidential actions, and articles. News is categorized by topic (i.e., economy and jobs), but the information hierarchy is confusing. Many of the news articles that are in briefings and statements are also under presidential actions, and some large, navigation links are broken, like https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/.

            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Finding news in the Bush, Obama, and Clinton White House pages is an easier experience compared to the Trump page that we have today. Additionally, without the clear distinction between briefings and presidential actions and articles, it is difficult to tell the level of authority of each information source and the purpose, while other webpages provide a clear categorization, and, in the case of the Obama website, even provide explanations for each category.
