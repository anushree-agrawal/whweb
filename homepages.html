            <h1>The History of White House Websites</h1>
            <h3>Homepages</h3>
            <p>
                This section will compare the different homepages for each president’s White House website. I will focus on answering the questions of what is advertised on each homepage, which is seen first by visitors, and how that tells us what is important to each administration. I will also focus specifically on the navigation that each website shows, because this navigation bar is visible on every page. 
            </p>
            <h3>Clinton</h3>
            <p>
                The Clinton homepage includes a rudimentary search bar and a sidebar that links to information about the people of the administration, the briefing room, progress of the administration, external agencies, and White House history, tours, and contact information.

            </figure>
            <p>
                What is notable about this homepage is that it includes a selection of recent press releases, and a link to a report that covers what the Clinton administration did. The original purpose of this first White House website was to provide citizens with easy access to press releases, so this homepage emphasizes this goal. The press releases showcased on the homepage paint the administration in a positive light, for example by showing work with Martin Luther King Day, and Internet strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are few photographs on this homepage. This is probably because internet speeds were slower in the Clinton era, so having a webpage that was media-rich would cause loading issues. There is also less content overall compared to the other White House webpages. This creates less distraction for users, and once again puts the focus on press releases. The Clinton archives also include a searchable library of White House publications from the administration, which shows that webpages at this time were to be simply document libraries for citizens. 
            </p>
            <h3>Bush</h3>
            <p>
                The Bush homepage is significantly more information-dense than the Clinton one. This may be because Bush’s presidency corresponded with a time where users were becoming more familiar with the internet and had widespread access to the internet. The Bush website is not only a repository for press releases, and includes more information about the administration and the issues that the President focused on.

                <figcaption id="caption">Bush-Era White House Homepage</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                The website includes a center panel that focuses on news, with large photographs of the former President and First Lady. The website has a right-side news sidebar, and a left-side navigation sidebar. The news section includes videos of the former President giving speeches, and of the Press Secretary giving Press Briefings. Unlike the Clinton site, the website has a top navigation bar, with a search bar.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the sidebar, the Bush homepage splits up information into 5 larger sections: “In Focus,” issues that the Bush administration was concerned with, “News,” “Interact,” a link to forums, where citizens are directly able to talk to people of the administration in sessions called “Ask the White House,” a section on people in the Government, like the Cabinet and Faith-Based and Community Initiatives and a “Nominations” section. 
            </p>
            <p>
                What is significant about this homepage is that information about the President, Vice President, and First Lady is linked to in the top navigation bar, with the side navigation bar reserved for the administration’s workings, unlike the Clinton webpage, where information was less hierarchical. This administration also highlights each important issue on the front page for users to see and links to relevant content under these issues, unlike the Clinton website, which only had information organized by date. There are 18 issues on the homepage, and there is not a focus on one particular area, which has an overwhelming feeling. The Bush website is also the first to have a Spanish translation available. 
            </p>
            <h3>Obama</h3>
            <p>
                The Obama homepage moves back to a less information-dense design than the Bush homepage, but stays with the hierarchal data form. There is a simple top navigation bar with expanding links: “Briefing Room,” for news, “Issues,” with a focus on 5 issues, “The Administration,” for info on people, and “1600 Penn,” for White House info. Compared to the Bush and Clinton homepages, the Obama homepage puts photos and media first. There are 5 issues highlighted on the home page, with large photos for each. There are also large photos of the President and the Vice President on the page. By highlighting only 5 issues, compared with the 18 of the Bush administration, the Obama administration seems more focused, and promotes a cleaner front. The Obama archives also include satellite websites, like the “We the People” website, where people can create petitions for the White House to review, a website for government datasets, and a website for Michelle Obama’s work on reducing obesity.

            </figure>
            <p>
                The Obama homepage also takes advantage of social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.). There are sharing links on each page of the website, and links to message and email content. The Obama webpage emphasizes access to information, especially related to the administration’s goals, and the ability for citizens to share this information with people in their networks.

            <h3>Trump</h3>
            <p>
                The Trump administration, has an upper navigation bar, with a pullout menu. The upper navigation bar puts issues of the administration more center than all of the other webpages—the five issues of the administration are the first thing on every page of whitehouse.gov. The Trump homepage has the largest photo of the president on the front page. It requires scrolling to see the full picture, and it currently links to a fact sheet on immigration. Because this photograph is so large, it further reduces the information content of the website.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                The homepage also includes a live Twitter feed of @realDonaldTrump, which provides more real-time content than other homepages. Other administrations, specifically the Obama administration, do not have this focus primarily on the president, and instead focus on the broader members of the administration. The homepage also includes a three large positive news stories, and a blurb on the History of the White House.

            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                All homepages, except the Trump one, include a full site map at the bottom. It is the hardest to find information on the Trump website, especially for users who are not familiar with three horizontal lines indicating a pullout menu. The sidebar pullout menu has content that is found on other White House websites, like news, issues, information on the administration, and visiting the White House, but because the issues for the administration take the spot of other information, the primary purpose for the website to be a repository of press releases is lost. The Trump administration is also the only one to include information that is not directly tied to the administration or its work on the home page, like history of the White House. 
            </p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>
                Because the Trump webpage is the only one that is currently in use, it has more of a forward-looking focus, while the other webpages focus on what the administration did, and provide more of a positive, backwards-looking view on the presidency. It will be curious to see how the post-Trump presidency website looks like in archive, compared to the Obama, Bush, and Clinton archives.
            </p>
            <p>
                As time went on, it is clear that websites contained much more information than simply press releases and White House materials. In fact, the Trump website makes it difficult to find press releases. White House websites have become a place for citizens to find out information about the issues that the administration cares about, and to find out “official” facts about these issues. It is troubling that the White House website has little oversight, because much of the information on the website is presented as fact. Incorrect statements, especially in the form of fact sheets, can be disseminated, and be seen as coming from a reputable source.
